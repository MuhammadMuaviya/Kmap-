Karnaugh Map Solver Using C++
Overview
This project aims to develop a versatile Karnaugh Map (KMap) solver implemented in C++. The KMap solver allows users to input the number of variables, generate the KMap layout, input truth table values, and then simplify the KMap to derive a Boolean equation. The program provides an interactive console interface and is designed to handle KMaps with 2 to 5 variables.

Detailed Description
Header Includes: The program includes necessary standard library headers such as <iostream> and <vector> to facilitate input/output operations and dynamic memory management, respectively.

Constants: Constants MAX_VARIABLES and MAX_SIZE are defined to set the maximum number of variables and the maximum size of the KMap, respectively. These constants ensure that the program can handle a wide range of KMap configurations while preventing memory overflow.

printKMap Function: The printKMap function is responsible for generating and printing the KMap layout based on the user-defined number of variables. It utilizes nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of variable values and prints the corresponding cell values in the KMap.

inputTruthTableValues Function: This function facilitates user input of truth table values for the KMap. It prompts the user to input the number of '1's in the truth table and their corresponding locations (min or max terms). The entered values are stored in an array representing the KMap.

simplifyKMap Function: The simplifyKMap function implements a placeholder simplification algorithm to simplify the KMap and derive a Boolean equation. It iterates through the KMap array and prints the simplified Boolean equation based on the '1's present in the KMap.

main Function: The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes the program by prompting the user to input the number of variables. It then validates the user input, generates the KMap layout, inputs truth table values, simplifies the KMap, and prints the simplified equation.

Example
Consider a scenario with a 3-variable KMap (Variables: A, B, C):

User inputs: 3
Number of ON bits: 6
Location of ON bits: 1 3 4 5 6 7
The generated KMap layout is displayed.
Simplified Equation: Out = B + C
Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Compile the C++ code using a compatible C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Execute the compiled executable.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of variables and truth table values.
Future Improvements
Implement a more efficient KMap simplification algorithm such as the Quine-McCluskey method.
Add robust error handling mechanisms to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.
Enhance the user interface with additional features for better usability and interactivity.
